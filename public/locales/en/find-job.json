    "Сезонная работа за границей": "Seasonal work abroad provides an opportunity to practice a foreign language, get to know the country, and see how people live. For the summer season, you can find seasonal work at tourist resorts. During the winter season, workers are always needed at ski resorts. These can be positions like animators, waiters, or kitchen assistants. There are also many jobs involving fruit and vegetable harvesting. Picking strawberries, raspberries, black and red currants, or apples are some of the most popular jobs offered in Europe. This work is great because it doesn't require strong language skills, allows you to earn money, and lets you learn about the lives of people in another country. Another seasonal employment option is working in nature reserves or taking care of children, elderly, or sick people."
